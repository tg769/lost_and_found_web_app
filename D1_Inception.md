# **D.1 Inception – Lost & Found Web App for Campus**

---

## **1. Introduction**

On university campuses, students and staff frequently misplace personal items such as IDs, keys, electronics, and water bottles, which leads to unnecessary stress, wasted time, and costs for replacements. Current solutions exists such as word of mouth, social media posts, or bulletin-boards are inefficient and unreliable. This lack of a centralized system means that valuable items often remain unclaimed or take a long time to be returned to their owners. Our project addresses this problem by proposing a **web-based Lost & Found platform** designed specifically for campus use. The system will serve as a centralized hub where community members can report found items and search for lost ones, ensuring a faster, more reliable, and campus-wide solution. By creating a dedicated application, we aim to reduce the inefficiencies of current methods, foster trust among students and staff, and improve overall campus life through streamlined item recovery.

## **2. Initial Value Proposition and Customer Segments**

- **Value Proposition (initial guess):** Students and staff will save time, avoid replacement costs, and reduce frustration by quickly reconnecting with lost items through a centralized campus Lost & Found platform.
- **Customer Segment (initial guess):** University students, faculty, and staff who frequently use campus facilities

## **3. Interviews Summary**

### **Interview 1**

- **Who was interviewed (role/background):** Aaron, undergraduate student, very protective of his personal belongings and cautious about how secure his information is.
- **Who participated in the interview (team members):** Myles
- **Interview date:** September 19, 2025
- **Customer segment represented:** University students who frequently move between classes, libraries, and recreational spaces on campus.

**Key Insights:**

- Aaron rarely loses items, but when he does, he becomes very anxious about what could have happened to his belongings.
- His main frustration is the lack of a trusted and centralized system that guarantees accountability. He is not comfortable posting in random group chats.
- He sees huge value in a web app that is secure. If the app doesn’t verify users and protect sensitive information, he wouldn’t use it.
- For him, the system isn’t about convenience but about peace of mind.

**Representative Quotes:**

- _“I don’t lose things often, but when I do, it’s a nightmare. I spend hours retracing steps.”_
- _“The problem isn’t just getting my stuff back, it’s making sure whoever found it isn’t snooping through it.”_
- _“Ok, but would the web app just let anyone see what is posted? And who it is posted by? I’d use it if it were safe.”_

**Assessment:**  
**Must Have** — Aaron’s strong emphasis on security and trust shows he would actively use a centralized lost-and-found platform. His language indicates genuine urgency and emotional investment.

* “As of right now there is no centralized way to track the items across departments. It’s not broken, but it could be a lot better.”
